Software is an iterative process. You will very rarely get it right the first time. If you ever do, the problem was likely simple.

**This implies simple problems are easier to solve well**.

Good software engineers reduce problems down to their most essential parts. This extends past the IDE. _Pushing back on product owners is one of our essential responsibilities._ By doing so, we stave off tech debt, complexity, over-engineered solutions, and god knows what else.

**[It is important to remember that the best code is the code not written](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/7emewv/miles_davis_famously_said_its_not_the_notes_you/)**.

Keep your problems small and comprehensible. Your code will likely be small and comprehensible as well.
